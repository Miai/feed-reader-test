# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I've implemented tests using Jasmine 3.3.0 to verify that the app functions as intended and making sure various functionalities are present and working as intended


## Why?

Learning how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
